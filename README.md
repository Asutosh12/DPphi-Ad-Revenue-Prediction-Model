# DPphi-Ad-Revenue-Prediction-Model

•A machine learning model was built to estimate the revenue that will be generated through ads. Secured the rank of 125 with a RMSE of 110.5042 and
accuracy score of 88.69 %.

•Performed preliminary data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to correct the highly sparse and skewed dataset. Applied Quantile Transformer for
removing the skewness. Employed feature engineering and removed some highly correlated features.

•Implemented XGBoost, Random Forest, KNN algorithm in the model .XGboost gives the lowest RMSE scores among the applied algorithms with
improvement from RMSE = 363.45 to RMSE = 110.054.
